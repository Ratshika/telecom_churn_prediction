## Prediction of Customer Churn in Telecom Industry

### Project Overview
- In the Indian Telecom Industry, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% customers who can be termed as high-value customers. Since the Telecom industry faces  an average of 15-25% annual churn rate, this project was built to help predict the customers who are at high risk of Churn, such that the Company can look into the requirements of the Customer earlier and provide them with offers and benefits in order to retain them.
- Since Prepaid Model is most commonly used in India, Customer churn was predicted based on their usage of Service. The Customer Activity for a span of 3 months was observed and analysed to find Patterns and was used to Predict if the Customer was going to churn or not.
- As the dataset contained a large number of features to predict from, the feature size was reduced using dimensionality reduction technique - **PCA**.
- The dataset was highly imbalanced, as the number of customers churning contributed to only 9% of the entire dataset. This was handled by adding synthetically generated points for the minority class using **SMOTE** technique.
- The final **Classification model** built using **Logistic Regressor** was able to predict **84%** of the customers who intended on churning.
- A **Decision Tree based model** was also built for identifying the top features that led to customers churning.

### EDA:

- It is observed that longer the tenure of the customer, lesser was the churn - as customers who are newly acquired to the network churned more as compared to the old customers.

## Recommended Strategies for Identifying Churn
The company can check,
- If there is any significant decrease in the outgoing or incoming calls, and the volume of 2g or 3g data consumed. If so, it can indicate that the customer is planning to switch to another provider.
- If there is a significant increase in local outgoing calls to the Customer care, it can indicate that the customer is facing many issues with the Teleprovider and can lead to customer dissatisfaction, inturn resulting in churn.
- If there is a significant increase in the roaming outgoing calls, then it can indicate that the customer is moving to a different place, and can plan on switching to the best provider in that location.
- If there is a significant decrease in the average revenue generated by the user in the past 3 months, it can indicate that the customer is planning to switch to another provider.
- If the customer is recharging for a very small amount on the last day of the month or does not recharge for almost one full month, then it can indicate that the customer is planning to switch to another provider.
- If the customer's age on network is less than 2 years, then their probability of switching to another service provider is high.

**Based on the above checks, the company can decide if the Customer is going to Churn or not.**
